## Overview
We have created a web application to aid the small scale farmers to make better financial decision for their produce. This app will therefore bridge the gap between the actual process of growing the crop and its financial aspects.
It Gathers necessary data about the farmerâ€™s current situation like:

1. The region(soil type, irrigability, etc)

2. Capital needed to be invested for his produce

This will be used to suggest the most appropriate crops based on physical factors(temp., humidity, etc) and thus appropriately distribute the capital according to the need of the crops.

## Installation Guide

`conda env create -f environment.yml`
